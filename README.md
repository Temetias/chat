## Requirements

- node v16.3.0 or greater (Might work on older versions too)

## Get started

- `npm install`
- Fill needed credentials in `src/conf.ts`
- `npm start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. (Should open automagically)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
